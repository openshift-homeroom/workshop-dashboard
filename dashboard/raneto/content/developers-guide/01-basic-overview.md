Title: Basic overview
---

This guide is to help you get started with using the workshop terminal
images. It provides details of the Git repositories containing the
source code used in creating the images, what functionality the images
provide, how to deploy the images, and how you can customise them to
include your own workshop content, or pre-load a workspace with files
required by a course.
